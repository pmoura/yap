This manual was originally written by Vítor Santos Costa, Luís Damas,
Rogério Reis, and Rúben Azevedo. Ricardo Rocha and Miguel Areias have significant contributios, namely in tabling. Paulo Moura and Ulrich Neumerkel have consistently provided helpful feedback.

It was largely based on the
DECsystem-10 Prolog User's Manual by D.L. Bowen, L. Byrd,
F. C. N. Pereira, L. M. Pereira, and D. H. D. Warren. We have used
comments from the Edinburgh Prolog library written by
R. O'Keefe. Documentation from many built-ins is originally from the
SWI-Prolog manual, with the gracious authorization from Jan
Wielemaker. We would also like to gratefully acknowledge the
contributions from Ashwin Srinivasian.
